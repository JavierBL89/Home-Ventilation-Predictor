    <p>Models have been trained with fake weather data genegerated by ChatGPT after several iteractions till getting a
        fairly realistic data of a whole year with outdoor and indoor temperatures fluctiations based on seasonality.

        <h2>📊 How We Predict the Best Ventilation Time</h2>
        <p>
            Our models have been trained using **synthetic weather data** generated by AI after multiple refinements
            to simulate **realistic seasonal temperature fluctuations** over a full year.

        <h2>🧠 How the Model Works</h2>
        <p>
            The model predicts the **most optimal time** of the day to ventilate your house based on **indoor and
            outdoor temperatures**. However, for real-world application, additional factors like **humidity levels**
            and **continuous temperature monitoring** would be necessary for greater accuracy.

        <h2>🌍 Prediction Limitations</h2>
        <p>
            Due to OpenWeather's **free-tier limitations**, predictions are made up to **2 days ahead** using
            hourly forecast data (available every **3 hours**). Forecasting is constrained to a **5-day window**
            from the time of request.
